## Project - Library Management System

You have a client that wants a system to allow for checking in and out books.

### Requirements

- [ ] Books can be added (no removal)
- [ ] Books can be checked out and checked in by any user
- [ ] Users can be added (no removal)
- [ ] The system should show what books are checked out to which users and if they are overdue
- [ ] Auth is not necessary
- [ ] Merely a page where the user can select themselves and select the book they want to check out
- [ ] All books are due within 7 days
- [ ] Backend can be written in a language of your choice, however it must use an ORM of some kind
- [ ] Frontend can be written in a language of your choice, however I would prefer a JS/TS framework
- [ ] The database should be containerized

### Notes

The things I want you to focus on are:

- Break down the problem into smaller parts
- Write a plan for each part
- Write the code for each part

We probably will not get to make the whole system, so focus on each chunk and make it work. The system does not have to be perfect and does not necessarily have to run/compile/whatever. This is merely a way to see how you approach problems, how you think, and what areas you can learn in.

This can also give you a project for a portfolio.
